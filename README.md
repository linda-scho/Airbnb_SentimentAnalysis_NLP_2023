# Airbnb_SentimentAnalysis_NLP_2024
This repository contains the code files and report for the project "Unleashing the Power of Large Language Models: GPT-3.5 and BERT versus Traditional Models for Sentiment Analysis
in Airbnb Review" developed as a final project in the course Natural Language Processing and Text Analytics at the Copenhagen Business School.

## Description
* **Project**: This project developed and compares two LLM models (BERT and GPT-3.5) with traditional models (Logistic Regression and Naïve Bayes)
for binary sentiment analysis based on scraped Airbnb review comments.Results show that GPT-3.5 has the highest macro F1 score of about 0.906.

* **Course**: The course taught students about the phenomena of text analytics and Natural Language Processing, including fundamental concepts, techniques and methods of Natural Language Processing. Students learned to analyze and apply different text analytics techniques for big/business datasets in organizational contexts, and understand the linkages between business intelligence and text analytics and the potential benefits for organizations. The course also covered the application areas, trends, and challenges in text analysis, and students were required to exhibit deeper knowledge and understanding of the topics as part of a project, with the report reflecting critical awareness of methodological choices and written to accepted academic standards.

## Data

* The dataset [BBBC041](https://bbbc.broadinstitute.org/BBBC041) is obtained from the Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection (BBBC) and holds 1.228 images that were manually created from P. vivax parasite infected humans in Manaus, Brazil, and Thailand with theire labels (infected or uninfected)
